<h2><ul><li>Key Facts</li></h2>
<h3><li>Height: 324 meters</li>
<li>Weight: 7,300 tons of iron</li>
<li>Location: Champ de Mars, Paris</li></ul></h3></p>
<h2><ul><li>Brief Summary of the Eiffel Towet</li></ul></h3>
<li>

The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous landmarks in the world, located in Paris, France. It was built for the 1889 World’s Fair to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel’s company, the tower took a little over two years to complete.

At first, many people criticized its unusual iron structure, but it later became a symbol of French creativity and engineering. The tower stands 324 meters tall and was once the tallest structure in the world. Today, it attracts millions of visitors each year and remains a global icon of Paris and France.<br>
The tower is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company built it.
But the actual design was made by two of his engineers:</li>
<li>Maurice Koechlin (chief engineer)</li>
<li>Émile Nouguier</li>
<li>Architect Stephen Sauvestre improved the design by adding arches and decorations.</li>
<ul><li>When it was being built, many artists and writers in Paris hated it.
They called it:

“A giant iron monster”

“A useless and monstrous skeleton”

But after the exhibition, people began to love it.</li></ul>

    Notre-Dame de Paris is one of the most famous Gothic cathedrals in the world and a major symbol of France. It is located on Île de la Cité, an island in the River Seine, in the heart of Paris.<br>
    Construction began in 1163 and took nearly 200 years to complete. For centuries, Notre-Dame has been the site of important historical events, including royal coronations and religious ceremonies. It also became world-famous through Victor Hugo’s novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, which helped save it from destruction in the 19th century.<br>
    In April 2019, a devastating fire destroyed the cathedral’s roof and spire. The structure itself survived, and a large restoration project began immediately. The fire deeply affected people in France and around the world.<br>
    Notre-Dame is not just a church—it is a cultural, historical, and artistic treasure. It represents French history, religious heritage, and architectural achievement, and it remains one of the most visited landmarks in Paris.<br>
