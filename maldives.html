      <br>
      Malé Island is the vibrant capital and largest city of the Republic of Maldives, a stunning nation of islands in the Indian Ocean. It's a highly unique destination, offering a stark contrast to the secluded luxury of the resort islands.

      <ul>
        <li>Densely Populated: Malé is one of the world's most densely populated cities. The entire island is virtually covered with colorful buildings, roads, and infrastructure, giving it a bustling, energetic atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Small and Walkable: Despite the density, the central island is quite small, and you can easily walk around the entire perimeter in about an hour, making it perfect for exploration on foot.</li>
        <li>Economic and Political Heart: It serves as the central hub for the Maldives, hosting the government and the main commercial port, with the economy largely driven by tourism and fishing.</li>

      <h1 class="heading">Hulhumalé Island</h1>
      <br>
        Hulhumalé is a unique, artificially reclaimed island in the Maldives, strategically developed as a "City of Hope" to address the overcrowding of the capital, Malé, and to act as a modern, resilient urban center for the nation's future.
      <br><br>
      <h3>Key Facts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reclaimed Land: Hulhumalé was created by pumping sand from the sea floor onto a submerged coral platform in the Hulhulé-Farukolhufushi lagoon, beginning in 1997.</li>
        <li>Climate Resilience: It was designed with a much higher elevation (around 2 meters above sea level) compared to the average Maldivian island (most are 1 meter or less), making it a key part of the national strategy to adapt to rising sea levels.</li>
        <li>Expansion of Malé: The island was developed as a planned city to relieve the population density of Malé, which is one of the world's most crowded capitals. It is planned to eventually house up to 240,000 inhabitants.</li>
